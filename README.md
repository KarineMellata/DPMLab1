## Bang-Bang controller
A bang–bang controller (2 step or on–off controller) is a feedback controller that switches abruptly between two states.

## P-Type controller
P-Type control or proportional control system is a type of linear feedback control system.
Proportional control is how most drivers control the speed of a car. If the car is at target speed and the speed increases slightly, the power is reduced slightly, or in proportion to the error (the actual versus target speed), so that the car reduces speed gradually and reaches the target point with very little, if any, "overshoot", so the result is much smoother control than on-off control.
